      <p>
        One of the central issues discussed in the context of the societal impact of language technology is that machine
        learning systems can contribute to discrimination, for instance by propagating human biases and stereotypes.
        Over the last couple of years, a lot of effort has been invested in addressing these issues through the
        development of tools for measuring and mitigating biases.
      </p>
      <p>Despite these efforts, we are far from protecting people from the potential harms caused by integrating this
        technology in their lives. At the same time, language technology is implemented with breathtaking speed in all
        kinds of applications that reach millions of users all over the world. This creates a rather absurd situation:
        On the one hand, this fascinating and advanced technology surprises us constantly anew with its growing
        capabilities. On the other hand, it is also holding us back by propagating existing (Western) stereotypes and
        biases to the global population at scale, and poses new risks of disadvantaging the vulnerable in society.</p>
      <p>
        To improve the effectiveness of our efforts to address these risks, we need to take a step back and re-evaluate
        our approach. Questions to consider are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is working about our methods of measurement and what is not?</li>
        <li>What can we achieve with bias mitigation, and what are the (proximate and inherent) limitations of this
          approach?</li>
        <li>Should we fundamentally rethink the way we approach algorithmic discrimination, and if so, which
          alternatives should we explore?</li>
        <li>How can we effectively combine the insights and expertise from other disciplines to create new perspectives
          on bias and discrimination in language technology?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different fields to discuss the state of the art
        on bias measurement and mitigation in language technology and explore new avenues of approach. We invite papers
        on new approaches to measurement and mitigation, as well as proposals for how to rethink our approach to bias
        and algorithmic discrimination more generally.

    <h4>Submission</h4>
    <p>Authors can submit an anonymous abstract of max 800 words (excluding references), with an optional additional
      page for tables and figures.</p>
    <p><strong>The deadline for the submission of abstracts is September 15th, 2024.</strong> Authors will be notified
      of acceptance by September 25th. Abstracts can be submitted using <a
        href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wai21">EasyChair</a>.</p>
    <h4>Presentation Format</h4>
    <p>We ask authors to indicate their preference for one of two presentation formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>20 minutes talk with 10 minutes discussion.</li>
      <li>poster presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The organizers will make every effort to accommodate your preferred format in the schedule. However, please note
      that final confirmation of the format of your presentation is subject to capacity and there is a chance that you
