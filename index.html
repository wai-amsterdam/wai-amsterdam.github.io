      <h2>Workshop</h2>
      <p>
        One of the central issues discussed in the context of the societal impact of language technology is that machine
        learning systems can contribute to discrimination, for instance by propagating human biases and stereotypes.
        Despite efforts to address these issues, we are far from solving them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different fields to discuss the state of the art
        on bias measurement and mitigation in language technology and to explore new avenues of approach. For more
        information, read our <i>Call for Abstracts.</i>
      </p>
      <p><strong>The <a href="call-for-abstracts.html#call-for-abstracts">Call for Abstracts</a> is currently open
          (deadline: September 15th, 2024)!</strong></p>

    <h4>Organizers</h4>
    <p>This workshop is organized by Katrin Schulz, Leendert van Maanen, Jelle Zuidema, Oskar van der Wal and Dominik
      Bachmann as part of the project <i>“The biased reality of online media - Using stereotypes to make media
        manipulation visible”</i>, which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). In this project we integrate
      knowledge from AI, psychology and linguistics to develop measures for social biases in language models and humans,
      and then to use these to study the influence of our media consumption on our beliefs.</p>
